\chapter{Basics of Recursive Bayesian Estimation}

In following sections the problem of recursive Bayesian estimation is stated and its anylitical
solution is derived. Later on, due to practical intractability of the solution in its general form,
a few methods that either simplify the problem or approximate the solution are shown.

\section{Problem Statement}

Assume a dynamic system described by a hidden real-valued \emph{state vector} \(x\) which evolves at
discrete time steps according to a known function \(f_t\) as described by
\eqref{eq:DynSysFt}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:DynSysFt}
	x_t = f_t(x_{t-1}, v_{t-1})
\end{equation}

Variable \(v_t\) in \eqref{eq:DynSysFt} denotes random \emph{process noise}, which may come from various
sources and is often inevitable. Sequence of \(v_t\) is assumed to be identically independently
distributed random variable sequence.

The state of the system is hidden and can only be observed though a real-valued \emph{observation vector}
\(y\) that relates to the state \(x\) as in \eqref{eq:DynSysHt}, but adds further \emph{observation
noise} \(w\).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:DynSysHt}
	y_t = h_t(x_t, w_t)
\end{equation}

In \eqref{eq:DynSysHt} \(h_t\) is known function and \(w_t\) is identically independently
distributed random variable sequence that denotes observation noise.

The goal of recursive\footnote{by the word recursive we mean that it is not needed to keep track of
the whole batch of previous observations in practical methods, only appropriate quantities from time
moments \(t-1\) and \(t\) are needed to estimate \(x_t\). However, this does not apply to the
derivation of the solution, where the notation of whole batch of observations \(y_{1:t}\) is used.}
Bayesian estimation is to give an estimate of the state \(x_t\) given the
observations \(y_{1:t}\) provided the knowledge of the functions \(f_t\) and \(h_t\).
More formally, the goal is to find the \pdf \(p(x_t | y_{1:t})\).
Theoretical solution to this problem is known and is presented in next section.

\section{Theoretical solution}

At first, we observe that \pdf \(p(x_t|x_{t-1})\) can be derived from
\eqref{eq:DynSysFt} (given the distribution of \(v_k\)) and that \(p(y_t|x_t)\) can be derived from
\eqref{eq:DynSysHt} respectively. (given the distribution of \(w_k\))

Because recursive solution is requested, suppose that \(p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\) and
\(p(x_0 | \{\})\)\footnote{known as the initial \pdf of the state vector} are known in order to be
able to make the transition \(t-1 \; \rightarrow \; t\).

In the first stage called \emph{prediction}, \emph{a priori} \pdf
\(p(x_t | y_{1:t-1})\) is calculated without knowledge of \(y_t\). We begin the derivation by
performing the reverse of the marginalization over \(x_{k-1}\).

\begin{equation*}
	p(x_t | y_{1:t-1}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x_t, x_{t-1} | y_{1:t-1}) \; \mathrm{d} x_{t-1}
\end{equation*}

Using chain rule for \pdfs, the element of integration can be splitted.

\begin{equation*}
	p(x_t | y_{1:t-1}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x_t | x_{t-1}, y_{1:t-1}) p(x_{t-1} | y_{1:t-1}) \; \mathrm{d} x_{t-1}
\end{equation*}

But \(p(x_t | x_{t-1}, y_{1:t-1})\) equals \(p(x_t | x_{t-1})\) (TODO: why? citation? linked to
\eqref{eq:DynSysFt}), leaving us with the result \eqref{eq:APrioriPdf}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:APrioriPdf}
	p(x_t | y_{1:t-1}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x_t | x_{t-1}) p(x_{t-1} | y_{1:t-1}) \; \mathrm{d} x_{t-1}
\end{equation}

As we can see, a priori \pdf only depends on previously known functions and therefore can be
calculated.

We continue by the second stage called \emph{update}, where new observation \(y_t\) is taken into
account and \emph{a posteriori} \pdf \(p(x_t | y_{1:t})\) is calculated.

\section{Requirements}

Ideal library for Bayesian filtering would posses following properties...:

\section{Programming paradigms}

Interpreted vs. Compiled

Object-oriented, procedural and Functional

pass-by reference vs. copy-on-write (Matlab)

\section{Survey of Existing Libraries for Bayesian estimation/decision making}

Brief survey of existing libraries ... not fullfilling all requirements..

The need to implement a new one :-)

\section{C++}

BDM

 - advantages of C (speed, C prevalence (many optimised libraries, BLAS, LAPACK.., OpenMP)

 - disadvantages of C in our ``situation'' (steep learning curve, coplexity because of low-levelness
   high initial barriers (need to have compiler, libraries...), inconveniently long edit/build/test
   process)

\section{Matlab}

BDM (partially?)

 - advantages (popularity, existing toolboxes, rapid development (high-level)

 - disadv: strict copy-on-write, problematic object model (not in original design), difficulties
           interfacing existing C (F) code

\section{Python}

NumPy.... parallelisation (approaches, improvements in Py 3.2) - GIL.. Py3k

\section{Cython}

general info etc... extension types, building, ease of interfacing C (and F) code, .pxd files,
NumPy support

[citations:\cite{BehBraSel:09,Sel:09,BehBraCitDalSelSmi:11}]

\subsection{Gradual Optimisation and Parallelisation}

how can optimisaion be approached (gradually) and why this approach is superior

integrate\_python\_cython example (``100x'' speedup for a special (very simple) case)

\subsection{Parallelisation}

integrate\_python\_cython patched with OpenMP (13x speedup in 16-core system)

prange CEP

\subsection{Pure Python mode}

About it and why it should be used in a hypothetical bayesian python library

\subsection{Limitations}

2 types:

	not-supported code (few cases, but bad, ongoing work)

	not-optimised code (much more work needed, but not hard to fix in most cases)

		- exception handling (functions returning void etc)

		- limitations of pure python mode in regards to traditional .pyx files

\section{Choice}

python/cython was choosen ...


\chapter{The PyBayes Library}

Introduction, general directions, future considerations

+ open development on github, open-source

\section{Interpreted and Compiled}

\section{Library Layout}

[proposed citation: \cite{Smi:05}]

\subsection{Random Variable Meta-representation}

Why it is needed (ref to ProdCPdf)

\subsection{Probability Density Functions}

Nice UML diagrams! (better more smaller UMLs than one big) One for general pdf layut, one for
AbstractGaussPdf family, one for AbstractEmpPdf family

\subsection{Bayesian Filters}

UML

Nice graph of a run of a particle filter (Mirda has the plotting code)

similar of marginalized particle filter? (gausses would be plotted vertically)

[mention this:\cite{Smi:10}]

\section{Documentation, Testing and Profiling}

TODO: move above Library Layout?

Documenting using Sphinx, approach to documentation (mathematician-oriented), math in documentation

Testing - the separation of

- tests: test one class in isolation, quick, determinism (would be good, not achievable)

- stresses: test a great portion of code at once, run longer, non-determinism..

Profiling python/cython - how, existing support in PyBayes

- how to correct profiling-induced overhead
