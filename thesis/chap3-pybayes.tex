\chapter{The PyBayes Library}

Introduction, general directions, future considerations

+ open development on github, open-source

\section{Interpreted and Compiled}

\section{Library Layout}

[proposed citation: \cite{Smi:05}]

\subsection{Random Variable Meta-representation}

Why it is needed (ref to ProdCPdf)

\subsection{Probability Density Functions}

Nice UML diagrams! (better more smaller UMLs than one big) One for general pdf layut, one for
AbstractGaussPdf family, one for AbstractEmpPdf family

\subsection{Bayesian Filters}

UML

Nice graph of a run of a particle filter (Mirda has the plotting code)

similar of marginalized particle filter? (gausses would be plotted vertically)

[mention this:\cite{Smi:10}]

\section{Documentation, Testing and Profiling} \label{sec:PyBayesDocsTests}

TODO: move above Library Layout?

Documenting PyBayes using Sphinx, approach to documentation (mathematician-oriented), math in documentation

Testing - the separation of

- tests: test one class in isolation, quick, determinism (would be good, not achievable)

- stresses: test a great portion of code at once, run longer, non-determinism..

Note about coverage.py!!

Profiling python/cython - how, existing support in PyBayes

- how to correct profiling-induced overhead

\section{Performance Comparison with BDM} \label{sec:PyBayesPerformance}
