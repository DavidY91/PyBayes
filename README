The most fresh development source is available from there.

Installing PyBayes
==================

PyBayes uses standard Python distutils for building and installation. Follow
these steps in order to install PyBayes:

# download PyBayes, let's assume PyBayes-0.1.tar.gz filename

# unpack it:
tar -xvf PyBayes-0.1.tar.gz

# change directory into PyBayes source
cd Pybayes-1.0

# build and install
./setup.py install

And you're done! Other installation and build options exist (TODO)

Testing PyBayes
===============

Once PyBayes is installed, you may want to run it's tests in order to ensure
proper functionality. The examples directory contains run_tests.py and
run_stresses.py scripts that execute all PyBayes tests and stress tests
respectively.

Note: running tests from within source directory is discouraged and
unsupported.
